A short note from the Director:

Typically whenever a developer has a game open sourced like this one might think that we're trying to get out of some work by recuiting help from the community and while we're going to plead the 5th on that particular point I think there's also the fact that we wanted the world to know that behind the scenes of this game there's quite a bit of nonsense and mistakes as well as a touch of genius that might make you think about programming diffferently. 

We hope that you will contribute to this crazy mess that we've grown to love over the past 10 months or so and find your way into the credits of the world's most advanced battle royale simulator: Ultimate Arena

-Troy Bonneau, President of Triverske
