; This is the file that has all the funny text stuff
; If you add new text make sure to increase the total of that section.
; $ is what to use for a character's name, % for he/she, @ for his/her, * for him/her
; some stuff is obviously not in the game yet, but we'll get around to it.
; you can add sections to character files for things that only that character would say.
; for example you could make Batman say during his think action "Batman misses his parents"
